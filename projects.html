          <p>My two biggest passions include teaching and researching. Through my time at the HEADT Centre, I was able to highlight these skills in unique ways. I was able to highlight my instructional skills through organizing workshops and webinars. I demonstrated my research and writing skills through the writing of a peer-reviewed article. A new skill I learned was how to market an organization through social media. Scroll to learn more about each unique project.  </p>

      <div class="workshopseries">
        <p>Throughout the entire summer, I worked on creating a unique series of workshops. As a former teacher, creating learning objectives and lesson plans is enjoyable to me. These workshops were created for PhD students from a variety of disciplines. Three separate workshops were created using the research of the HEADT Centre, and real-world examples as case studies. Topics of the workshops were plagiarism, data integrity, and image manipulation in research. The workshops are scheduled already, with one being complete. More on these workshops can be found on the HEADT Centre website, <a href="https://headt.eu/Workshops">here</a>!</p>

        <p>I assisted in the development and performance of an experiment related to fake news and information integrity in online sources. After the experiment, I aided in the research and writing of an article for the German library journal. The article is currently in the peer-review process. Through this experience, I learned how to research and write within a team. Having to combine many different visions and projects, while combining three different writing styles can be difficult. But our final project was stronger than any one of us writing the article alone. I am proud of our work and am looking forward to seeing the final product in print.</p>

      <div class="socialmedia">
        <p>I was the social media content creator for the HEADT Centre. It was the first time I had done any type of social media branding or marketing for an organization. I increased the frequency in which the HEADT Centre tweeted to 2-3 times a week. I also increased our followers from 36 to 44, including having the US Office of Research Integrity follow us and retweet our content.</p>
